{: shortdesc}

-   For {{site.data.keyword.ibmwatson}} resources that are created in the European Union (EU), see [Requesting support for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.watson}} resources created in the European Union](#request-EU).

## Requesting support for IBM Cloud Watson resources created in the European Union
{: #request-EU}

European Union support is provided 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by IBM support engineers who are located in Europe for customers who have created a resource in the Germany region and have selected the EU Supported option. Global teams provide additional support only at the discretion and under the direction of the EU support team. Global teams might be contacted, for example, when issues are not resolved by the Level 1 or Level 2 support team in the EU and expertise is needed from a global Level 3 support team member.

You can specify that you want support for your account from the support team that is physically located in Europe if the following criteria are true:

-   Your master user or account owner set the EU Supported option for your account.
-   Your resources are in the appropriate European data center.
-   You select the EU supported ticket level when you open the ticket.

For the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform, only services that are hosted in the Germany region with the EU Supported option can be supported by a team that is physically located in Europe.

Setting the EU Supported option for your account applies to all future tickets that you open for issues on any service or data center that is hosted in the EU region. Any tickets you opened prior to setting this option are not affected. If you set this option and you add resources outside of an EU data center or the Germany region, issues for those resources are not necessarily handled by a support team in Europe.

For more information about setting up your account to be EU supported, see [Enabling the EU supported option](/docs/billing-usage/eusupported.html#bill_eusupported).
