# {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} development approaches

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} supports a few different approaches for developing applications for {{site.data.keyword.watson}} services applications and running them in Bluemix. The approaches are functionally equivalent and work equally well, so choose the method with which you are most comfortable.

If you develop your application outside of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you don't need to use these approaches. However, you do need a {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account to create instances of {{site.data.keyword.watson}} services.

## {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} web interface

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} site to create applications quickly by using a starter.  A *starter* is a template that includes predefined services and application code and is configured with a particular buildpack. There are two types of starters: boilerplates and runtimes. For details, see [Creating Cloud Foundry Apps](/docs/cfapps/index.html).

## Eclipse IDE

You can use the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE) to work with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} applications. For details, see [Deploying apps with IBM Eclipse Tools for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/manageapps/eclipsetools/eclipsetools.html).

## Cloud Foundry CLI

You can use the Cloud Foundry `cf` command-line interface (CLI) tool to work with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services and applications on your local system. For details, see [The Cloud Foundry command-line interface](/docs/services/watson/getting-started-cf.html).
