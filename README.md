Using importable automations, new automations via OpenAPI, and robotic process automation (RPA), Watson can deliver stand-alone tasks, or sequence tasks to handle more complex work. These tasks are known as skills. Watson can also work with defined groups of skills, or skill sets, which can have context and memory.
